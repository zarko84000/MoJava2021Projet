# MoJava2021Projet

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide an Java code for developping an AI (in our case an multilayer perceptron) who will be able to learn how to predict basics mathematics operations like addition, soustraction and multiplication.

## How to run the java code ? 

First you need to compile the code with `javac`. 
Then you will just need to run with `java Test/test` and you will have the output of the main in your terminal. 

IMPORTANT : you will need to uncomment the content of the main for trying one model. After that you can change the numbers of hidden layers etc...
